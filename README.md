In this coursework, you will explore the popular self-supervised contrastive learning approach SimCLR.

You will be asked to implement some of the key components of SimCLR, including a suitable data augmentation strategy (for generating positive pairs), the SimCLR loss function, and the SimCLR training step. Additionally, you will be using transfer learning strategies for evaluating the performance of different pre-trained models for a downstream classification task.

The coursework is divided into three-parts:
- Part A: Implementation of a suitable dataset for contrastive model training;
- Part B: Implementation of the SimCLR loss and training step;
- Part C: Implementation of transfer learning strategies (linear probing and finetuning) for model evaluation.
